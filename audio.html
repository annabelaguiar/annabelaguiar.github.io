        <h4>WFHB</h4>
        <p>As an intern at WFHB’s Daily Local News during the fall semester of my sophomore year, I had to report, write, record and edit pieces on a tight turnaround of five and a half hours before the afternoon newscast, covering  Indiana in the 2018 midterm elections, Indianapolis’ bid for an Amazon headquarters and homelessness in Bloomington. I also reported features on child welfare, education, maternal mortality and the effects of clear cutting a national forest, as well as broadcasting live for election night return analysis.</p>

        <h4>Indiana Daily Student</h4>
        <p>While I was interning at WFHB, I pitched a podcast at the IDS with my friend Chris Forrester: it was called Double Feature, and each week we chose a theme, watched two movies and had a discussion between us (two movie snobs) and occassionally guests from the staff of the IDS. We never expected the largest audience, given that we talked about a Jacques Demy movie once, but we were regularly surprised and outperformed more-regularly promoted IDS sports podcasts occassionally.</p>
