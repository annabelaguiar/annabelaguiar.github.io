        <h2>Research and Scholarship</h2>
        <h4>Board of Aeons</h4>
        <p>During my senior year at IU Bloomington, I have served as a member of the 99th <a href="https://aeons.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Board of Aeons</a>, a student board that advises the President on pressing strategic issues affecting undergraduate student life. The Board was founded in 1921, and operates under a general rule of confidentiality as teams spend a year preparing their research report and robust recommendations. Applicants proceed through a multi-round process before being individually selected by the President.</p>
        <p>Research conducted for my team's yearlong project included literature reviews, peer institution reviews, interviews with administrators and key stakeholders, focus group conversations, institutional data and an independently created student survey.</p>

        <h4>Media and Cultural Studies</h4>
        <p>In addition to my journalism work and studies, I pursued a specialization in Media and Cultural Studies at the Media School later in my degree progress thanks to a life-long love of film and a want to become more academically engaged in a traditional sense. I have taken courses on the films of the Coen Brothers, the films of Dziga Vertov, media as a social institution, tricky questions of authorship surrounding the bible, Twentieth century European cinema, art and ideology in the Third Reich and (obviously) more.</p>

        <p>My undergraduate academic work culminated in my senior year in my research paper &#128206;
            <a href="documents/vertov.pdf" target="_blank"><em class="download"> Examining Dziga Vertov's Theory of the Interval through Generational Representations (PDF, 6.2 MB)</em></a>, where I sought to reconsider the influential experimental filmmaker's role in cinematic history and use one of his core theories of visual communication to analyze ideological throughlines in his work, as seen in regards to political concepts of youth and the elderly in the contemporary Soviet context.</p>
